<p class="paragraph">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA dog is one of the most adorable creatures that we can have in our life. They are known for their loyalty, which is one of the reasons on why they are said to be a man's best friend. 
These creatures were full of energy and were so lovable. Some studies show that having a pet like dogs can help us to relieve stress. These cheerful creatures can brighten up our day and make us smile or laugh by simply just existing in our lives. 
A dog is one of the types of pet who greets us by the door after a long day of being away from home. We have a dog and her name is Mallows. She greets us by the door when we get home with a puppy eyes and a cute bark like she miss us and was so delighted to finally see us again. 
When she came into our life, she makes us laugh and smile more often.
I also support the slogan "Adopt, don't shop" because by doing so, no matter their breed, we can help in giving every animals a chance to have a better life and be loved.</p>
