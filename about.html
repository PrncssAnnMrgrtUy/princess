<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHi! I'm Princess Ann Margaret E. Uy and I'm from Batangas City. I'm 20 years old. 
I graduated Elementary at UCCP Hope Christian School of Batangas, Inc. In Junior High School and Senior High School (STEM Strand), I graduated at Batangas State University-Pablo Borbon Campus.
I'm currently a Third Year College student at Batangas State University-Alangilan Campus taking BS Information Technology Major in Business Analytics 
under the College of Informatics and Computing Sciences (CICS) Department.  
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My favorite color at the moment is baby pink. My hobbies are listening to music, watching kdrama, drawing, playing mobile games and board games.
I'm trying to learn how to sketch on my free time because it amazes me how other people can do beautiful artworks and how art can help to convey our feelings or emotions through lines and colors. In kdrama, one thing I can say about it is that it has moral lessons that 
anyone can apply in their own life. That is one of the reasons on why I became a fan of watching kdrama. Also, some OST that I heard from the kdrama that I have watched are all good.
There are many good songs that I have listened to and one of my favorite song is Fireflies by Owl City, a song that seems to be timeless. </p>
